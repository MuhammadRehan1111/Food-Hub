# Food-Hub
A QR-based restaurant ordering chatbot for dine-in customers. It shows multi-category menus with prices and deals, accepts item quantities, and responds in the user’s language (English, Urdu/Roman Urdu, Arabic). Orders are saved as pending, while payment and analytics are handled by the cashier and admin panel.
